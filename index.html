            My name is Ian Dunkelberg and welcome to my portfolio. I’m a full stack web developer, a musician, and mathematician. I graduated from Western Washington University with a Mathematics / Computer Science degree in 2020.

            Western Washington University’s Mathematics / Computer Science (M/CS) degree focuses on how computer scientists interact with mathematics. Aside from writing programs in R, Mathematica, and MATLAB to solve mathematical problems programmatically the combined M/CS classes focused on how to approach math in computer friendly ways. The prime example of this is how to rewrite the quadratic formula to minimize floating point error when b ≈ b²−4ac. The main takeaways from my degree was the shared problem-solving skills in mathematical proofs and designing algorithms.

            In 2019, I completed the University of Washington Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. Over the course of 24 weeks learned Full Stack Web Development using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js (MERN). I completed three full stack projects serving as project leader for two to three fellow classmates. For each of these projects we had to design and implement a website in about three weeks.

            For the capstone project I pitched my team on the idea of creating an online IDE for front end designers (I didn’t find out about CodePen or jsfiddle until after we had submitted our project plan). This project morphed into p3 IDE.

            I’m a huge music fan. I picked up playing guitar and bass in high school. As I’ve grown as a musician I ‘ve started paying more attention to effects pedals and synthesizers. This new interest in guitar gear has led me to the DIY guitar effects and programmable synthesizers scenes.
