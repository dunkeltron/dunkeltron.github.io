            Hi my name is Ian Dunkelberg. I am a full-stack web developer. I specialize in the MERN stack and I’m deeply familiar with modern web technologies. 
            <br ><br>
            
            
            I love finding solutions. In my time at Western Washington University I focused on using Mathematics to find computer based solutions to complex mathematical problems. During this process I realized that I could solve more problems by applying my skills to the web. I graduated from the University of Washington’s Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp in February of 2019.
            
            <br ><br>
            
            My experience in the bootcamp gave me the tools necessary to craft elegant solutions to modern problems. I used React.js and Bootstrap to create a memory game that can be seen here. For our capstone project, my team of three created an in browser front end web development environment using the MERN stack which you can see here.
